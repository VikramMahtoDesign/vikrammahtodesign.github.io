## Introduction
Introduction

Transformer tanks are critical components in electrical power systems, and their structural integrity during lifting operations is paramount for safety and reliability. During manufacturing, transportation, and installation, transformers must be lifted using designated lifting lugs or bollards. A proper lifting analysis ensures that these lifting points can safely support the transformer's weight without excessive deformation or failure.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to perform a suspended condition lifting analysis of a transformer tank using ANSYS Mechanical, with a specific focus on the application of remote points a powerful feature that simplifies constraint definition and accurately represents lifting cable connections.
