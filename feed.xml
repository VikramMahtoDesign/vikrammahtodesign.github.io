I’ve been exploring it for the last six months, and now I have a basic idea of how things work. You don’t have to be a programming geek to learn how to get things done using Pro/Toolkit, but a basic understanding of C/C++ is required to get started.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Creo Pro Toolkit is a powerful API that allows users to automate, customize, and extend the functionality of Creo Parametric. It provides a set of functions that enable developers to interact with Creo models, assemblies, and drawings programmatically. Many engineering companies use Pro Toolkit to improve design efficiency, reduce repetitive tasks, and create specialized applications tailored to their workflows.</p> <p>For someone starting out, Pro Toolkit may seem overwhelming at first, but once you get familiar with its structure and functions, it becomes much easier to work with. The key is to practice by working on small automation projects and gradually exploring more complex functionalities.</p> <h2 id="learning-resources">Learning Resources</h2> <p>If you’re interested in getting started with Creo Pro Toolkit, here are some useful resources:</p> <h3 id="1-ptc-documentation">1.

Iron is magnetic. Nickel is magnetic. So why doesn’t your SS316 stainless steel stick to a magnet? This puzzle reveals how atomic structure, crystal arrangement, and alloy chemistry create materials with unexpected properties.</p> <h2 id="foundation-magnetism">Foundation: Magnetism</h2> <h3 id="the-atomic-origin">The Atomic Origin</h3> <p>Magnetism arises from unpaired electrons. When electrons pair up with opposite spins, their magnetic moments cancel. Unpaired electrons create a net magnetic moment turning each atom into a tiny magnet.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Ferromagnetism</strong> occurs when atomic magnetic moments spontaneously align in the same direction. Iron, nickel, and cobalt exhibit this through quantum mechanical exchange interactions, creating magnetic domains where billions of atoms align together. This produces strong macroscopic magnetism.</li> <li><strong>Paramagnetism</strong> involves unpaired electrons but lacks cooperative alignment. Atomic magnets remain randomly oriented. External magnets cause weak, temporary alignment hundreds of times weaker than ferromagnetism.</li> <li><strong>Diamagnetism</strong> occurs in materials with all paired electrons. External fields induce weak opposing currents, creating subtle repulsion.</li> </ul> <h2 id="foundation-crystal-structures">Foundation: Crystal Structures</h2> <h3 id="the-atomic-architecture">The Atomic Architecture</h3> <p>Crystal structure : how atoms arrange themselves , fundamentally affects material properties, including magnetism.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Body-Centered Cubic (BCC):</strong> Atoms at cube corners plus one at center. Each atom has eight nearest neighbors. Room-temperature iron (ferrite) has this structure. The specific atomic spacing creates optimal conditions for strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions.</li> <li><strong>Face-Centered Cubic (FCC):</strong> Atoms at cube corners plus one at each face center. Each atom has twelve nearest neighbors in dense packing. High-temperature iron (austenite) and many other metals adopt this structure.</li> </ul> <h3 id="the-critical-insight">The Critical Insight</h3> <p>The same element can be magnetic or non-magnetic depending on crystal structure.</p> <p>Iron demonstrates this perfectly:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Ferrite (BCC iron)</strong> at room temperature: strongly ferromagnetic</li> <li><strong>Austenite (FCC iron)</strong> above 912°C: weakly magnetic (paramagnetic)</li> </ul> <p>The iron atoms haven’t changed only their spatial arrangement. In BCC ferrite, atomic geometry favors parallel magnetic moment alignment. In FCC austenite, different atomic spacing weakens these interactions, preventing cooperative ferromagnetism.</p> <h2 id="the-iron-story-the-austenite-problem">The Iron Story: The Austenite Problem</h2> <h3 id="the-phase-diagram-puzzle">The Phase Diagram Puzzle</h3> <p>The iron-carbon phase diagram shows which crystal structures are stable at different temperatures. The critical feature: below 727°C, austenite (FCC) is thermodynamically unstable in plain carbon steel. It should transform to ferrite (BCC) and cementite (Fe₃C).</p> <p>Yet 304 and 316 stainless steels are austenitic (FCC structure) and used at room temperature far below 727°C. How can austenite exist where it shouldn’t?</p> <h2 id="the-stainless-steel-solution-alloying-creates-metastable-austenite">The Stainless Steel Solution: Alloying Creates Metastable Austenite</h2> <h3 id="nickel-the-austenite-stabilizer">Nickel: The Austenite Stabilizer</h3> <p>Nickel is an austenite-forming element that extends the temperature range where austenite is stable, pushing it downward. Nickel itself prefers FCC structure, so dissolved nickel atoms favor FCC arrangement in steel.</p> <p>For 18% chromium steel, approximately 8% nickel makes austenite stable (or metastable) at room temperature. This is why austenitic stainless steel is 18-8 composition.</p> <h3 id="chromium-the-dual-role">Chromium: The Dual Role</h3> <p>Chromium provides corrosion resistance through a protective oxide film. Additionally, when combined with nickel, chromium retards the kinetics of austenite-to-ferrite transformation dramatically slowing it down.</p> <p>Even if thermodynamics says austenite should transform, slow kinetics mean the transformation takes decades or longer. For practical purposes, austenite is stable.</p> <h2 id="the-non-magnetic-answer-why-austenitic-stainless-steel-isnt-magnetic">The Non-Magnetic Answer: Why Austenitic Stainless Steel Isn’t Magnetic</h2> <h3 id="the-mechanism">The Mechanism</h3> <p>When iron transforms from BCC ferrite to FCC austenite, magnetic properties change fundamentally. The FCC structure creates different atomic spacing and coordination that disrupts magnetic exchange interactions.</p> <p>In austenitic stainless steel, two factors eliminate ferromagnetism:</p> <ol> <li><strong>FCC Crystal Structure Effect:</strong> Different atomic geometry weakens the exchange interactions that promote magnetic moment alignment.</li> <li><strong>Alloying Complexity:</strong> Chromium and nickel create a heterogeneous atomic environment. Iron atoms are surrounded by a mixture of different elements rather than uniform iron. This disrupts the regular magnetic interactions needed for ferromagnetism.</li> </ol> <p>According to materials research, “the microstructure appears to be more random at the atomic layer, meaning that the electrons are unable to align their rotation in a consistent direction.” The complex atomic neighborhood prevents cooperative magnetic alignment.</p> <h3 id="why-magnetic-domains-dont-form">Why Magnetic Domains Don’t Form</h3> <p>Ferromagnetism requires magnetic domains regions where billions of atoms align their magnetic moments. In austenitic stainless steel, this cooperative alignment doesn’t occur. Atomic magnetic moments remain randomly oriented. The result is paramagnetism: weak, random atomic magnets producing negligible macroscopic magnetization.</p> <h2 id="critical-clarification-fcc--non-magnetic">Critical Clarification: FCC ≠ Non-Magnetic</h2> <p><strong>Important:</strong> FCC crystal structure does NOT automatically mean non-magnetic.</p> <ul> <li>Pure nickel has FCC structure and is strongly ferromagnetic</li> <li>Cobalt (at room temperature) has FCC structure and is ferromagnetic</li> </ul> <p>FCC structures can absolutely be magnetic. So why is austenitic stainless steel non-magnetic?</p> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It’s the combination of FCC structure plus specific alloy chemistry (chromium, nickel, manganese) that disrupts magnetism. When iron transforms to FCC austenite in plain iron, it loses much ferromagnetism due to changed atomic spacing. But adding substantial chromium and nickel creates additional disruption beyond crystal structure alone.</p> <p>The heterogeneous atomic environment iron surrounded by different elements prevents the cooperative magnetic alignment that pure nickel achieves in its FCC structure.</p> <p>The lesson: Crystal structure influences magnetism, but electronic structure, alloying effects, and atomic environment all play critical roles. It’s not structure alone.</p> <h2 id="common-misconceptions">Common Misconceptions</h2> <p><strong>Myth 1: “Stainless steel isn’t magnetic.”</strong> <strong>Reality:</strong> Only austenitic stainless steel is non-magnetic (paramagnetic). Ferritic and martensitic grades are magnetic.</p> <p><strong>Myth 2: “If it’s magnetic, it’s not real stainless steel.”</strong> <strong>Reality:</strong> 430 ferritic stainless steel is genuinely stainless despite being magnetic. Grade choice depends on application requirements.</p> <p><strong>Myth 3: “Non-magnetic = better quality.”</strong> <strong>Reality:</strong> The correct grade for the application represents quality. Sometimes austenitic is ideal; sometimes ferritic is the sensible choice.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Austenitic stainless steel’s non-magnetic nature isn’t a defect—it’s a consequence of its FCC crystal structure achieved through careful alloying. By adding nickel (austenite stabilizer) and chromium (corrosion resistance + kinetic retardation), materials scientists created an alloy where austenite exists indefinitely at room temperature as a metastable phase.</p> <p>The non-magnetic behavior results from:</p> <ul> <li>FCC structure’s effect on atomic spacing and magnetic exchange interactions</li> <li>Alloying-induced disruption of the atomic environment</li> <li>The combination preventing cooperative magnetic domain formation</li> </ul> <p>This same FCC structure also provides exceptional corrosion resistance and low-temperature toughness that make austenitic stainless steel indispensable in demanding applications.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="materials"/><category term="materials"/><category term="metallurgy"/><category term="stainless-steel"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This puzzle reveals how atomic structure, crystal arrangement, and alloy chemistry create materials with unexpected properties.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with plotly.js</title><link href="https://vikrammahtodesign.github.io/blog/2025/plotly/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with plotly.js"/><published>2025-03-26T14:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-26T14:24:00+00:00</updated><id>https://vikrammahtodesign.github.io/blog/2025/plotly</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://vikrammahtodesign.github.io/blog/2025/plotly/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an example post with some <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">plotly</a> code.</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">plotly

During manufacturing, transportation, and installation, transformers must be lifted using designated lifting lugs or bollards. A proper lifting analysis ensures that these lifting points can safely support the transformer’s weight without excessive deformation or failure.</p> <p>In this blog post, we’ll explore how to perform a <strong>suspended condition lifting analysis</strong> of a transformer tank using <strong>ANSYS Mechanical</strong>, with a specific focus on the application of <strong>Remote Points</strong>—a powerful feature that simplifies constraint definition and accurately represents lifting cable connections.</p> <h2 id="what-is-lifting-analysis">What is Lifting Analysis?</h2> <p>Lifting analysis is a structural finite element analysis (FEA) performed to evaluate the stresses, strains, and deformations in a structure when it is suspended by lifting points. For transformer tanks, this analysis helps engineers:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Verify</strong> that lifting lugs can safely support the total weight.</li> <li><strong>Identify</strong> stress concentrations and potential failure points.</li> <li><strong>Ensure</strong> compliance with design codes and safety standards.</li> <li><strong>Optimize</strong> lifting lug design and placement.</li> <li><strong>Validate</strong> that deformations remain within acceptable limits.</li> </ul> <h2 id="understanding-suspended-condition-analysis">Understanding Suspended Condition Analysis</h2> <p>The analysis methodology presented here simulates the transformer tank in a <strong>suspended equilibrium condition</strong>—that is, when the tank is already lifted and hanging stationary from the lifting cables.</p> <p>This represents the state where:</p> <ul> <li>The tank is fully supported by lifting cables at designated lifting points.</li> <li>All forces are in equilibrium (no acceleration).</li> <li>The structure experiences maximum sustained loading.</li> <li>Cable tensions equal the distributed weight of the transformer.</li> </ul> <p>This approach is widely used in industry as it provides a clear, direct assessment of structural stresses while the transformer hangs suspended during transportation or installation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/lifting-analysis/01-suspended-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Suspended equilibrium condition of Transformer cover"/> <em>Figure 1: Suspended equilibrium condition diagram.</em></p> <h2 id="why-use-remote-points">Why Use Remote Points?</h2> <p>Remote points in ANSYS are powerful tools that allow you to apply constraints at a reference location that is connected to a set of nodes or surfaces through kinematic coupling equations. They are special nodes in the model that represent a collection of points or a portion of the structure, helping to simplify complex behaviors by reducing multiple degrees of freedom to fewer, manageable ones.</p> <h3 id="how-remote-points-work">How Remote Points Work</h3> <p>Remote points function through <strong>Multi-Point Constraint (MPC)</strong> equations that manage the relationship between independent and dependent degrees of freedom:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>remote point</strong> acts as an independent node in space coordinates.</li> <li>The <strong>scoped geometry</strong> (lifting hole surface) contains dependent nodes.</li> <li><strong>MPC equations</strong> link these together, transferring constraints from the remote point to the geometry.</li> <li>Dependent degrees of freedom are eliminated from the system, simplifying the solution process.</li> </ul> <p>This mechanism ensures that constraints applied remotely are correctly transferred to the actual model geometry while maintaining physical accuracy.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2> <h3 id="1-geometry-preparation">1. Geometry Preparation</h3> <p>Start with a 3D CAD model of your transformer tank. The model used in this analysis was created in Creo and imported into ANSYS.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/lifting-analysis/02-cleaned-geometry.jpg" alt="Cleaned geometry"/> <em>Figure 2: Cleaned CAD geometry ready for analysis.</em></p> <p><strong>Essential components to include:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Main tank body (shell)</li> <li>Lifting lugs with mounting pads</li> <li>Major structural reinforcements</li> <li>Base plate or support structure</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Remove small features like bolt holes if they’re far from critical regions. Keep the lifting lug geometry detailed as it’s the region of interest.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="2-material-definition">2. Material Definition</h3> <p>Define material properties in ANSYS Engineering Data.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Material:</strong> Structural Steel (typical for transformer tanks)</li> <li><strong>Young’s Modulus:</strong> 200 GPa</li> <li><strong>Poisson’s Ratio:</strong> 0.3</li> <li><strong>Density:</strong> 7850 kg/m³</li> <li><strong>Yield Strength:</strong> 250 MPa</li> </ul> <h3 id="3-contact-definitions">3.

Creating Coordinate Systems</h3> <p>Create coordinate systems at the <strong>lifting hook position</strong>. This is the point where the lifting cables (slings) converge and connect to the crane hook.</p> <p><strong>Understanding Sling Geometry:</strong> In practical lifting operations, multiple slings connect the lifting lugs to a common lifting hook above. The geometry involves:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Slinging angle:</strong> The angle between the sling and the vertical axis (typically 60° as per standard practice).</li> <li><strong>Lifting angle:</strong> The angle at the hook where slings converge.</li> <li><strong>Hook height:</strong> Vertical distance from lifting lug to the hook convergence point.</li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/img/lifting-analysis/03-cbip-sling-geometry.jpg" alt="CBIP Manual Section CC Sling Geometry"/> <em>Figure 3: Sling geometry reference (CBIP Manual: Section CC).</em></p> <p><strong>Steps to create Coordinate System:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Select the internal surface of the lifting lug/eye or surface of the lifting bollard.</li> <li>Insert → Coordinate System.</li> <li>This will create a Coordinate System at the centroid of the lifting lugs (x,z).</li> <li>Add a <strong>vertical offset</strong> for the location of the Lifting hook (y). <em>(If hook height is unknown: Calculate it from sling length and angle).</em></li> </ol> <p><img src="/assets/img/lifting-analysis/04-csys-created.jpg" alt="Coordinate System Created at Hook Location"/> <em>Figure 4: Coordinate System created at the theoretical hook convergence point.</em></p> <h3 id="6-creating-remote-points---the-key-step">6.

Applying Loads</h3> <p>The suspended condition analysis requires applying all downward forces that the lifting system must support.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Load:</strong> Standard Earth Gravity</li> <li><strong>Application:</strong> Insert → Standard Earth Gravity</li> <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Negative Y-axis (or Z-axis, depending on your coordinate system)</li> <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> 9.81 m/s² (automatically applied)</li> </ul> <p><strong>What this does:</strong> It applies gravitational acceleration to all bodies. The weight is calculated automatically (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Force = Mass × 9.81</code>), where Mass comes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Volume × Density</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog focuses on empty tank lifting, so we only use Standard Earth Gravity.

mass of your geometry from the properties menu: <img src="/assets/img/lifting-analysis/08-geometry-properties.jpg" alt="Geometry Properties showing Mass"/> <em>Figure 8: Checking total mass in geometry properties.</em></p> <p>Next, check the resultant force from the reaction probes: <img src="/assets/img/lifting-analysis/09-reaction-forces.jpg" alt="Reaction Force Probe Results"/>

<li>Reactions in Y (from ANSYS) = <strong>133,460 N</strong></li> </ul> <p>Since $133,514 \text{ N} \approx 133,460 \text{ N}$, the force balance confirms that the model is in equilibrium, the setup is correct, and the results are valid.</p> <h2 id="what-do-the-standards-say">What Do the Standards Say?</h2> <p>Ensure your design complies with relevant local and international standards.</p>
